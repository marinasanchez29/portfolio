# portfolio
I followed Tech Elevator Alumni Support Team's tutorial, created by Daniel Commins, to set up my portfolio page.
I utilized a free resume template from Start Bootstrap, which can be found here: https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume. 
I updated some of the sections found in the default template (split "Experience" into "Technical Experience" and "Professional Experience" and replaced "Awards" with "Side Projects") and populated everything with my information.
